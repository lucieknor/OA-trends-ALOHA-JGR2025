# OA-trends-ALOHA-JGR2025
This repository contains the complete code for data analysis and generation of figures in Knor et al. (2025): Drivers and Variability of Intensified Subsurface Ocean Acidification Trends at Station ALOHA.

## Main Files:
### oatrends_knor_environment.yml  
This contains the Conda environment in which the code is run. You can generate a functioning environment to run the code on your machine from this file if you follow the instructions at https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file

### OATrends_Knor2025_JGR_Code.ipynb
This is the Jupyter Notebook with the complete Python code. It generates multiple output files of all figures and numerical results shown and reported in Knor et al. (2025).

### hd113191.nc
This is the raw Hawaii Ocean Time-series bottle data, the main dataset used in Knor et al. (2025). It is generated by download from the HOT-DOGS database. Analysis can be repeated with updated datasets that can be downloaded at https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/hot-dogs/interface.html

## Auxiliary data files:
The Jupyter notebook reads in a few other auxiliary data files that are too large or have copyright issues and are therefore not included in this repository. The file sources are also indicated in the Jupyter Notebook itself. Below is a list of the files needed and the URLs/DOIs that they are currently found at (and hopefully remain in the future). Last update: 4/2025.
